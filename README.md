## JAVA

Java is a programming language.<br/>
Contrary to **_'C++'_** it initially designed as **OOP language**.<br/>
And it uses JVM(Java Virtual Machine) which allows JAVA to run independently of the operating system.<br/>
JAVA applications only communicate with JVM, not hardware or os. And JVM converts and delivers commands received from JAVA so that OS can understand them.<br/>
So the program that programmed with JAVA can executable in anywhere. And it also expressed as "Write once, run anywhere".<br/>
